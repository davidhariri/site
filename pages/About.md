I am an autodidact maker, mainly of programs for the web. I currently live in Toronto and work at [Ada](https://ada.support), a company I co-founded in 2015.

I love hearing from people. Email me at [david.hariri@gmail.com](mailto:david.hariri@gmail.com)

Here are some things that I am dedicating most of my waking life to:

**Artificially intelligent agents at [Ada](https://ada.support)**

I believe that by 2030, 95% of people's communication with businesses will be with an AI agent. Talking to these agents will be delightful and fast.

**No-code workflow automation at [Stitch](https://stitchbits.co)**

I believe that programming is still too unapproachable for the average person. Why do we continue to force ourselves to learn abstractions built for the constraints of computing in the 1970s? In the future, I think everyone in a business will have a tool that allows them to automate the work of their whole company so that most of a companies work becomes more meaningful.

**Making UIs that are fun to use**

I believe that optimal software solves deep user needs, but is also fun to use. Fun UI is fast, approachable and pragmatic. I believe all software should be fun to use and easy to extend.

I also love to read, be outside (running, hiking), take photographs and pass time with my family and friends.
