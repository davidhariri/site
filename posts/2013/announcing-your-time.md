title: Announcing Your Time

[Your Time](https://web.archive.org/web/20130823071532/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/your-time/id646402971?ls=1&mt=8) (my first app for the iPhone) HAs been approved! An update will follow some time in the next two weeks that will fix the issue of favorites not saving between sessions. I've already got a lot planned for version 1.2 which I think will be the final version where I implement all the fancy features I have floating in my head. Check it out on my website or on the app store for free.

Unnamed movie project is coming along nicely for those that follow this. I got instagram and I've added a photos section to my site.
