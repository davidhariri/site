I love making software for the web. I try to make things that are useful and easy to use and that scale. I currently live in Toronto and work at [Ada](https://ada.support), a company I co-founded with [Mike Murchison](https://murch.me) in 2016. Ada fully resolves aproximately six million customer support requests per month for over 400 customers.

The projects I'm currently working on are listed on my [now page](/now).

Outside of coding and helping the team at Ada, I love to read, "touch grass" (running, hiking, skiing), take photographs and spend time with my family and friends.
