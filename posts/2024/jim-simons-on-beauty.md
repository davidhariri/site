title: Jim Simons on beauty

[Jim Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Simons_(mathematician)) passed away today. One of the more interesting books I read last year was his biography 'The man who solved the market'.

> "Be guided by beauty. I really mean that. Pretty much everything I’ve done has had an aesthetic component, at least to me. Now you might think ‘well, building a company that’s trading bonds, what’s so aesthetic about that?’ But, what’s aesthetic about it is doing it right. Getting the right kind of people, and approaching the problem, and doing it right […] it’s a beautiful thing to do something right."
