I think modern air travel is such an astounding human invention. All the little machines, systems and feedback loops that need to work _just right_ to keep the plane flying in all kinds of insane atmospheric conditions ... It blows my mind every time I fly even though it's not a novel experience anymore. And now, I can surf the net from my seat at [`30Mbps`](https://www.speedtest.net/result/c/fe77a1bc-5209-4864-9353-c6c8aae4ea2c)! I can work on Ada's code without losing my use of our cloud services and coding assistants.

Like many, I've always been able to get great reflection and work done on flights. Flying was a rare moment of forced unreachability where my environment removed the normal cues to check and send on my phone. I say _"was"_ because that's all changed in the last two or three years. I now notice that it's expected by some that I am still reachable when I fly. It's a subtle expectation, but it's there.

On the one hand, I always aim to be someone dependable and I do have a lot of tasks every day that require communication. On the other, as my responsibilities have grown, my time for reflection and deep work has shrunk. I often long for open blocks to write or just close my eyes and reflect on where I have come from and where I am going in all the many parts of my life. Flying used to be one of those uncontested times for me, but Intelsat had other plans. Good for them.

As I write this, I'm on a flight to Vancouver to panel with my friends [Dennis](https://twitter.com/dennispilarinos) and [Allen](https://allenpike.com/) at InnovateWest. As I reflect on this trip, I feel lucky to call them friends because they are excellent makers and of great character. I feel lucky that anyone thought to invite me to this and that anyone is interested in what I have to say.
