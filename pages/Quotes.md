Dwight D. Eisenhower on Focus (1961 address to the Century Association):

> "Who can define for us with accuracy the difference between the long and short term! Especially whenever our affairs seem to be in crisis, we are almost compelled to give our first attention to the urgent present rather than to the important future."

Steve Jobs on living:

> "When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world.
>
> Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.
>
> That's a very limited life.
>
> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.
>
> Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."
