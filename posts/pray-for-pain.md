In "Don't wish it was easier", [DHH Writes](https://world.hey.com/dhh/don-t-wish-it-was-easier-9018b6d7):

> > Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better.
> > 
> > Don’t wish for less problems, wish for more skills.
> > 
> > Don’t wish for less challenges, wish for more wisdom.

Which is an adaptation from the Stoic's ["amor fati"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati) (Latin for "love your fate"). He goes on later to quote the Christian version, which is also great:

> > I asked for strength and god gave me difficulties to make me strong.
> > 
> > I asked for wisdom and god gave me problems to solve.
> > 
> > I asked for courage and god gave me dangers to overcome.
> > 
> > I asked for love and god gave me troubled people to help.
> > 
> > My prayers were answered.
