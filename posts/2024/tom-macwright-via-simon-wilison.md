Tom MacWright on Tech Debt

> Building technology in startups is all about having the right level of tech-debt. If you have none, you’re probably going too slow and not prioritizing product-market fit and the important business stuff. If you get too much, everything grinds to a halt. Plus, tech debt is a “know it when you see it” kind of thing, and I know that my definition of “a bunch of tech debt” is, to other people, “very little tech debt.”
