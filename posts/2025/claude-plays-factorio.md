[Jack Hopkins](https://jackhopkins.github.io/) has created ['FLE' (Factorio Learning Environment)](https://jackhopkins.github.io/factorio-learning-environment/), an LLM test environment for Factorio where he tests  to see how well they can programatically play the game.

The architecture is policy-driven, where the policy is a sequence of actions for various scenarios.

The results have a clear winner, with Claude outperforming the other LLMs tested which makes me like Claude even more than I already do.
