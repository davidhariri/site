> “_Somebody_ doesn’t work here.” As in, “Somebody should fix the typing lag in the search input” or “Somebody should follow up with the teams that churned last week.” Nope.

Slack was made in Canada. Thanks to Johnny Rogers and Ali Rayl for [documenting](https://buildingslack.com/you-asked/) the creation of Slack.
