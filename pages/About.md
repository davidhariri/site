I love making software for the web. I currently live in Toronto and work at [Ada](https://ada.support), a company I co-founded with [Mike Murchison](https://murch.me) in 2016.

Here are some things that I am dedicating most of my waking life to:

**AI Agents for Customer Support at [Ada](https://ada.support) (2016 â€” Present)**

I believe that by 2030, 95% of customer support will be handled by AI agents, not people. That used to be a weird idea, but since ChatGPT, it now feels almost inevitable. Customer support is often a repetitive and thankless job. Most businesses are forced to use contract labor to grow their customer support teams which often leads to a lack of training and a lack of motivation to satisfy customers. I want to change that by building a system that delights customers and beats competent human performance for the majority of many business' customer support needs.

**Making UIs that are fun to use (Perrenial)**

I believe that the best software solves deep user needs, but should also be *delightful* to use. Fun UI is fast, approachable and pragmatic. I believe all software should be fun to use and easy to extend.

Outside of coding and helping the team at Ada, I love to read, "touch grass" (running, hiking, skiing), take photographs and spend time with my family and friends.
