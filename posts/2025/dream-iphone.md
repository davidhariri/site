This is basically an iPhone 17 Pro in terms of power and performance, but in a 1st gen iPhone SE chassis (with a slightly larger screen) designed for people who prefer a smaller form factor, less camera features, more tactility and great battery life.

**Features**

- One-handed operation
- Faster open with fingerprint sensor
- Simpler navigation with home button
- Pocketable
- Flat when resting on a surface
- "All day" battery life

**Trade-Offs**

- Not quite as water-proof due to the home button
- No Face ID
- No Wide and Telephoto lenses
- Thick (+3mm compared to the iPhone 13 mini)

This is an iPhone that Apple seems to be totally uninterested in making, but if they did, I would buy five of them. Maybe it's something John Ternus will bring to life.
