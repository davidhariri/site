I’ve decided that serving a folder of static html is where it’s at. 

Last year I made more than 30 commits to this site’s application code just to serve my blog from MongoDB. This allowed me to make posts on the go with iA Writer.

Ultimately, this was becoming expensive and annoying to tune. Publishing was easy, but editing a post after it had been published required me to edit it in the database. And, the performance of the site was slower than some of my friends sites that were simpler.

So, I’ve re-launched this site on Netlify and built a static-site generate in the process. As usual, all the code is [on Github](https://github.com/davidhariri/site).
