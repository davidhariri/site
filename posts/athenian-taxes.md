From [Thomas Martin on Big Think](https://bigthink.com/the-past/ancient-greece-taxes/):
> In ancient Athens, only the very wealthiest people paid direct taxes, and these went to fund the city-state’s most important national expenses – the navy and honors for the gods. While today it might sound astonishing, most of these top taxpayers not only paid happily, but boasted about how much they paid.
> 
> Money was just as important to the ancient Athenians as it is to most people today, so what accounts for this enthusiastic reaction to a large tax bill? **The Athenian financial elite felt this way because they earned an invaluable payback: public respect from the other citizens of their democracy.**

This is how it should feel to be a tax payer. It is a privilege to get to contribute more to making your city and country better for everyone.
