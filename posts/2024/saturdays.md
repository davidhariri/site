A lot of the time I work on Saturdays, but since my son was born it’s become an important day for me to step up as a dad and husband. Today, Jas, Monica and I went to the new house to check out the progress.

The house is looking amazing. And then when we got home, I picked up some meat and cheese from my favourite grocery store and then him and I took a 2 hour nap.

All in all, I’m learning to take Saturdays slower and starting to even enjoy it without feeling too guilty about being unproductive.

But come Sunday, I’ll be back at my keyboard and loving that too.
