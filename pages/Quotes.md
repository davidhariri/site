Dwight D. Eisenhower on Focus (1961 address to the Century Association):

> "Who can define for us with accuracy the difference between the long and short term! Especially whenever our affairs seem to be in crisis, we are almost compelled to give our first attention to the urgent present rather than to the important future."

Steve Jobs on living:

> "When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world.
>
> Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.
>
> That's a very limited life.
>
> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.
>
> Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."

[Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) on having skin in the game (1910 speech in Paris ['Citizenship in a Republic'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic)):

> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

[Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) worries for a decline of America in [The Demon Haunted World (1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World). He appears to have predicted much of what has come to bear in the 25 years after.

> “I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, **unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true,** we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...
> 
> The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance”
