Perplexity has a MacOS app [now](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/perplexity-ai-for-mac-now-available/)! It’s really good. Generally, as a research tool, #Perplexity beats everything else for many of my day to day work tasks. Take a look at this beautiful research I just did on service-desk KPIs.
