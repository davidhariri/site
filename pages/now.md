## Working On

**[AI Agents for Customer Support at Ada](https://ada.support) (2016 â€” Present)**

I believe that by 2030, 95% of customer support will be handled by AI agents, not people. That used to be a weird idea, but since ChatGPT, it now feels almost inevitable. Customer support is often a repetitive and thankless job. Most businesses are forced to use contract labor to grow their customer support teams which often leads to a lack of training and a lack of motivation to satisfy customers. I want to change that by building a system that delights customers and beats competent human performance for the majority of many business' customer support needs.

**[This Site](https://dhariri.com)**

Call it old school, but I still believe in the dream of a global network of computers that can be used to share information and ideas. I also believe that the web is a better place when it is [open](https://github.com/davidhariri/site), protocol-driven and independent. I believe that we should all be able to make some sort of website that represents who we are and what we care about. I also believe that individuals should be the curators of what they consume. While social platforms like X, Instagram, TikTok and Reddit make it easier than ever to learn and share, they are engineered for engagement and to serve the interests of their owners and their customers (advertisers).
