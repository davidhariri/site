Every winter I take the TTC to work and every winter my sense of safety has gotten worse.

I used to be the guy telling people to ignore sensational news reports about rider assaults.

I’ve reversed my position.

It’s not safe anymore to use the subway if you aren’t prepared to deal with threats. I saw three men just this week off their heads screaming at passengers, threatening them, and disturbing the operation of the train.

In some cities, this is absolutely not tolerated, but in all these cases, there was no transit police and the train operators did nothing. This is not a debate about shelters, sympathy for the unhomed or people in the throws of mental illness and addiction. This is about **basic public safety** and usable civil services.

What kind of city do we want to be, Toronto? A place where violence and unusable services is normalized? I’m lucky enough to *choose* to use the TTC (as opposed to having no other option). I believe that hallmarks of great cities are beautiful public spaces and safe, efficient transit that only the foolish or incapable ignore. Right now, *I’m* feeling like the fool for riding the TTC.
