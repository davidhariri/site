description: I made a thing that converts your pocket saves into an rss feed
---

I've been using [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) for years now to save articles and other stuff I find on the internet. But in 2024, they decided to [end their RSS support](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1czso6p/pockets_rss_feeds_have_been_discontinued/). I am an [avid user](https://dhariri.com/blog/rss-setup/) of RSS so naturally I was sad to see this happen. So, I decided to make an app that generates an RSS feed from your Pocket saves so that you and I can continue to use our favorite RSS readers.

You can find the app [here](https://pocket-rss.com). It takes just two clicks to generate your RSS feed. I would love your feedback on it.
