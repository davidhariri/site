      "content": "<article><p>Tom MacWright on Tech Debt</p><blockquote><p>Building technology in startups is all about having the right level of tech-debt. If you have none, you’re probably going too slow and not prioritizing product-market fit and the important business stuff. If you get too much, everything grinds to a halt. Plus, tech debt is a “know it when you see it” kind of thing, and I know that my definition of “a bunch of tech debt” is, to other people, “very little tech debt.”</p></blockquote><ul><li>Tom <a href=\"https://macwright.com/2024/10/25/good-software-knip\">MacWright</a></li></ul><p>. #startups</p></article>",

Thankfully, the new owner of the domain and content Alex Xu is awesome too (check out the <a href=\"https://blog.bytebytego.com/\">ByteByteGo newsletter</a>), but I miss the look and feel and the less polished posts of the High Scalability of yore. My favourite post was the deep dive on how Netflix works<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>. This bit on the transcoding blew me away:</p><blockquote><p>For The Crown, Netflix stores around 1,200 files!</p><p>Stranger Things season 2 has even more files. It was shot in 8K and has nine episodes. The source video files were many, many terabytes of data. It took 190,000 CPU hours to encode just one season.</p><p>The result? 9,570 different video, audio, and text files!</p></blockquote><div class=\"footnote\"><hr><ol><li id=\"fn:1\"><p><a href=\"https://highscalability.com/netflix-what-happens-when-you-press-play/\">What Happens When You Press Play</a>&nbsp;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">↩</a></p></li></ol></div></article>",
