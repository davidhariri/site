Very interesting post outlining the results of letting LLMs play chess. All models were “terrible” except for turbo-instruct which was excellent. 

Was it tuned for chess? Were games a big part of its training set?

Edit: seems like[^1] post-training is dulling chess ability, but it can be recovered with fine-tuning?
