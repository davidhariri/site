My goals:
1. To understand my self and my reality
2. To love and to be loved
3. To realize my potential

Experiences that every human should have
- To have love, then lose it and then find it again
- Become an addict and then overcome your addiction with will
- Make a lot of money (successful dentist money, let's say) and then lose it all or lose the taste for it
- Run a marathon
- Swim alone across a still lake in the mist
- Swim alone in crashing waves

Experiences that every software founder should have
- Make something with all of your skill and heart that no one wants
