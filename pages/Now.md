This is my [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

## Working On
- Leading the design of our new office at 46 Spadina Ave
- Working out how to accelerate the adoption of our generative product
- Helping us keep our architecture simple and robust

## Life Events
- Expecting my son (our first born!) on June 7th 2024
- Moving to the home we have been making with [my dad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamak_Hariri) for over 3 years

## Currently Reading:
- A Brief History of Intelligence by Max Bennett
    - Loving this book so far. It's given me a deeper appreciation for the perfection in our own bodies.

- The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves by Matt Ridley
    - So-so on this. It's filled with great facts, but the presentation is dry.

- _Listening to_: The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal by M. Mitchell Waldrop
