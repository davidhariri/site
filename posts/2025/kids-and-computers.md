Recently I overheard a parent declare "we're a screen-friendly household" and felt my brain convulse. Their kid is not even a year old.

I don't know anything about the developmental science of giving kids access to games and television whenever they want, but I can't imagine a world where it's considered good for the kids development.

What I do know is that giving myself this same access has been an exercise in discipline and restraint. I also know that today's devices and software have not been built with developing happy children as the goal. If I, as a 34 year old, am struggling to use my phone productively, how can I possibly expect a kid to? 

Here comes the "old man yells at cloud" part...

When I was a kid, the computer was in a room, tethered to a wall. As I got older, it migrated into my room, and when I was in high school, I got a laptop (lucky me). Until I was 12, I had to ask my parents for permission to use the computer, and I remember well the cries from my mother to turn it off and go outside if I ever tried to use it past the alotted time. Oh, and violent video games were completely forbidden. I don't remember ever feeling frustrated about this. In fact, I internalized that it was better for me.

So we are decidedly **not** a screen friendly household. Whenever my 10-month old reaches for my wife's phone we rip it out of his hands and throw it across the room. The only thing we let him use it for is FaceTime with his grandmother in Australia and its always with one of us.

When he gets older, I'm really excited to give him his first computer. It will be an iMac, tethered to the wall, in the family room, with no web browser and only programs and games that I hand select for him. 
If you think that's draconian, or archaic, I don't mind. If you feel like I'm not being compassionate enough weary parents, that's OK with me. I am judging for myself what is right for my kid and don't care about what parents need or what society is normalizing. Kids rely on their parents to discern for them what is good for their development and what isn't. That is what I intend to optimize for.
