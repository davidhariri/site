Small site update: My posts now automatically get posted to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dhariri.com). I am digging the vibe at Bluesky more than Twitter these days.

I still plan to blog as my primary means of publishing thoughts to the web, but one idea I might try is using Bluesky for commenting[^1].

[^1]: Emily Liu has a [great write up](https://emilyliu.me/blog/comments) about how to implement this.
