description: I’m officially a dad to my now four-month-old son, Jasper. It’s been
  a long journey to get here, but every moment is worth it. I plan to share more about
  our fertility journey someday, but right now, I'm just savoring these precious moments
  and looking forward to watching him grow.

I don’t think I have actually written yet on my blog that I am now a father. Jasper is four months old now. It took my wife and I a very long time to have our first, but it was worth all of the effort and trials. It’s everything people tell you it will be (and a lot they don’t and probably can’t). It’s hard to describe and impossible to prepare for.

I will write more about our fertility “journey” (epic?) some day in the hope that it helps others going through it, but for now, I’m trying to just enjoy being on the other side.

I am grateful every day that he is healthy and happy. I can’t wait to see who he will become. I will try to be as good of a dad as my dad was to me.

Maybe one day he will read this.
