Large Language Models (LLMs) are a new form of machine learning model derived from trillions of words of text, mostly from the internet. The way they work is simple and the results are astounding. LLMs are the biggest advancement towards general intelligence yet. I believe they are already having profound effects on industry and art.

## Overview

LLMs create completions from a prompt a series of words (a sentence, for example). Given a sequence of words, they will predict what the next sequence of words ought to be based on patterns derived from derived patterns in human language. Here is an example prompt:

> The following is a poem about a programmer named David:

And here's the completion from the LLM:

> David, David,
> The programmer of my dreams,
> He can code in any language,
> And he always gets the job done,
> 
> He's the perfect man for me,
> And I know we'll never part,
> 
> Because he's the one who coded my heart.

The example was generated by [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://beta.openai.com/playground) LLM, but [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/gpt2?text=Once+upon+a+time%2C) can produce similar results too.

This example is called zero-shot learning because I didn't have to show the LLM what a poem is. It could tell from my prompt that the best completion would be something that resembled a poem and it also knew to make the subject me, David.

If we give the LLM some examples of what we want within the prompt, it gets even better:

> The following is a poem about walking and bravery:
> 
> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
> And sorry I could not travel both
> ...
> 
> The following is a poem about forests and fear of death:
> 
> Whose woods these are I think I know.   
> His house is in the village though;   
> ...
> 
> The following is a poem about a bird:

And here's the compleltion:

> I heard a bird sing   
> In the dark of December.   
> A magical thing   
> And sweet to remember.   
> 
> We are nearer to Spring   
> Than we were in September,   
> I heard a bird sing   
> In the dark of December.

Beautiful, right? So, what can this do for you (other than write poems)?

**If you are a creative professional:**

- They can work as a research assistant for you
- They can work as a generator of divergent thoughts.
- They can scaffold writing for you.

As a creative myself, I think this accelerates creative work by making it faster to generate ideas and scaffold out the rote parts of creativity. I use [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) every day to scaffold code. I am still the editor and final approver of my code, it's just a much more capable automatic completion generator.

**If you are a business:**

- They can take many pieces of text and summarize them.
- They can write articles, messages, emails and any other form of common correspondance.
- They can generate lists of industries.
- They can generate product descriptions.
- They can generate advertisement copy.
- They can detect anomolies or sentiment from text.

As a founder, I think LLMs will be used by every department of businesses over the next three years to make work more efficient. Most of that interaction will be through SaaS products that sit on top of OpenAI's API. Those SaaS products will excel at creating valuable prompts and fine-tuning the LLM for their needs through positive reinforcement feedback loops.

## Pitfalls

The biggest problem with LLMs is that they have no concept of truth or logic. They will use any set of words that they think best complete a given prompt, even if those words aren't factual or are contradictory statements.

Another problem with LLMs is they are inherently out-of-date. They are trained on massive amounts of text over many thousands of hours. Training an LLM the size of GPT-3 costs millions of dollars. This means they are always going to be months or even years behind current events. It would not surprise me if GPT-3 had no idea about the current war in Ukraine.

## Future

It is already rumored that OpenAI is working on a much larger GPT-4 model which could double the length capacity for prompts and produce much more factually accurate completions. This would make business applications that rely less on human approval possible.

Recent advances in AI make it an exhilerating (sometimes dizzying) time to be building AI applications. I am excited to see a whole new generation of startups emerge from the value created by applying LLMs.
