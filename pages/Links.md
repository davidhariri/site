### People

- [Tehching Hsieh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehching_Hsieh) is a performance artist known for his "One Year Projects" that mix life and art and require incredible dedication and sacrifice. Watch [this video of his work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoNd254KrjU&t=11s) to understand why I have included him in this list.
- [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang) is a brilliant sci-fi writer who writes short stories that take my mind places I didn't think were possible.
- [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) is a pionoeer of computer software and the inventor of the Unix operating system (and philosophy) which my Mac is still based on.
- [Yuki Kawauchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Kawauchi) is a Japanese elite runner who won gold at the 2018 Boston Marathon. He is completely self-trained, has no sponsorships and holds down a 40 hour per week job working night shifts for his government. [He trains 130-140km per week](https://runningscience.co.za/elite-athletes-training-log/yuki-kawauchi/) and is known as elite distance running's ["oddball"](https://archive.md/BXSl2).
- [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) is my favourite science educator of all time (second place goes to [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)). His research into extraterestrial life, his contributions to Voyager, and the genuine zeal for space he brought to Cosmos make him worthy of anyone's time.
- [Ilya Sutskever](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ilya/) is a brilliant AI researcher. He is a co-founder of OpenAI, co-creator of AlexNet and ChatGPT and has a knack for explaining complex ideas in simple terms and in a calm way. I highly recommend [this fireside talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GKou6lSfi0) with him and Nvidia founder Jensen Huang. [His Lex Fridman interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13CZPWmke6A) is also worth a listen and especially interesting given it was recorded before the release of ChatGPT.
- [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html) for his essays on startups and the life of a founder.
- [Salvatore Sanfilippo aka antirez](http://invece.org) invented Redis which is a very fast and easy to use database.
