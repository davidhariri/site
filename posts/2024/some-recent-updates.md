title: Some Recent Updates
---

I made some updates to the site tonight:

- Improved AI description generation (Fixed issue [#48](<https://github.com/davidhariri/site/issues/48>))
- Updated my [About](/about), [Now](/now), and [Tools](/tools) pages
- Consolidated some tags that were duplicated in intent.
- Updated the footer
- Use GPT-4o, Pydantic and `.chat.completion.parse` to get a description and list of tags for new posts

I am also sad to announce that I tore down [Stitch](https://stitchbits.co) earlier today. It was a super fun thing to build, but it was costing me $75 a month to operate and hadnâ€™t run any workflows in several months. Iâ€™ll dust it off one day, but for now I am fully focussed on Ada. 

Itâ€™s 12:15 AM here so Iâ€™m off to bed now ðŸŒ™
